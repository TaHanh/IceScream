For starters, the controls don't work as well as they should for a game in which you have to run away from a child predator. Not only does it not let you interact with objects unless you're positioned just right, but the movement controls are really clunky. It also doesn't help that the ice cream man has better situational awareness than he should for a man wearing a large, unwieldy mask (or is that his head?). And yet he sometimes canâ€™t find you even when he sees you you duck into a hiding spot. All of which is why Ice Scream: Horror Neighborhood isn't even as scary as getting brain freeze from a milk shake.",
